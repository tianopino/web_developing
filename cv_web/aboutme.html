			<p>
			Hello, I'm Gu Tian. This is me at Royal Docks, London
			(05/2021).I graduated with a Master's degree in Linguistics
			from UCL in 2021. My primary interest in linguistics are phonetics, phonology and
			the interdisciplinary NLP (natural language processing). I'm also
			interested in the various Chinese dialects, especially Wu (commonly known to the English-speaking world 
			as Shanghainese) and Yue (Cantonese). I enjoy travelling,
	        record collecting and learning to code during my leisure time. </p>

			<p>
			I grew up in a beautiful city (Yixing) located along Tai Lake where people speak a variety of Wu Chinese called 
			Yixing Wu. My hometown is famous for its teapots made from purple clayï¼Œand the large number of researchers who was born 
			in Yixing for which it is known as the "hometown of professors", trasnliterately. If you could find Shanghai, Nanjing 
			and Hangzhou on a map of China, you could easily pinpoint Yixing, which is at the center of the triangle formed by the 
			three cities.
